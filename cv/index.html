        My work focuses mainly on developing models and designing studys to measure the impact of programs that support our Commerical and Medicare members. I work closely with business partners across the organzation to rapidly iterate through R&D discovery phase and in turn build out reproducible and scaleable results. I also support with the the training and development, integrating new tools and building out a new workflow for analytics within my team.

        Prior to my work at Blue Cross, while completing my master's degree  I was a Data Analytics Fellow on the City of Boston's Citywide Analytics team. I focused on peformance measurement where I worked with a few departments helping to improve their consumption of analytics by recommending KPI's and building out dashboards for real-time measurement.

        Before this life, coming out of undergrad, I served 2-years as an AmeriCorps Member with City Year––an organization that uses data and small group interventions to improve outcomes of low performing high-need urban schools. The school I worked with went through an impressive transition over the two years, and at the end of the 2014-2015 school year was the school was the most improved K-8 school in Boston in ELA and Math. Furthermore, they ranked #2 and #4 in most improved K-8 in ELA and Math, respectively, across all of Massachusetts. I took that experience with me to the Achievement Network, an education consulting organzation, and focused on our teacher facing web platform as well as supported our consultants with a data-driven approach to resource selection and curation based on school and district needs.
