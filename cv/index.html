        My work focuses mainly on developing models and designing study's
        to measure the impact of programs on our Commerical and
        Medicare members. I also support with the the training and development

        Prior to my work at Blue Cross, I was a Data Analytics Fellow for the City of Boston
        working on the CityWide Analytics team while I was completing my master's degree. 
        I focused on peformance improvement where I worked with a few departments helping to 
        improve their analytic capabilities by improving KPI selection and building out 
        dashboards for real-time measurement.

        Before this life, coming out of college, I served 2-years as an AmeriCorps Member with 
        City Year--an organization that uses data and interventions to improve outcomes of high-need urban schools. 
        At the end of my term, the school I worked with became the most improved K-8 school in Boston 
        in ELA and Math, and ranked #2 and #4 in ELA and Math, respectively, in most improved K-8 schools across 
        all of Massachusetts. I took that experience with me to the Achievement Network, an
        education consulting organzation, and focused on our teacher facing web platform
        as well as supported resource selection in mathematics and training on mathematics education.

        I have a Bachlor's of Business Administration from University of Massachusetts 
        Amherst and a Master's in Analytics from Bentley University.
